# 🚀 AgentFast v1.2: The Ultimate AI SaaS Launchpad

## Slide 1: AgentFast v1.2 accelerates AI SaaS development from months to days
### Ship your production-ready AI product with a battle-tested foundation.
AgentFast v1.2 is the ultimate Next.js 16 boilerplate designed for indie hackers who want to bypass the repetitive setup of authentication, payments, and database management. By providing a pre-configured, high-performance stack, it allows founders to focus 100% of their energy on their unique AI features rather than the underlying infrastructure.

## Slide 2: Founders waste 80% of their development time on non-core boilerplate
### Building a modern AI SaaS requires complex integration of multiple fragmented services.
Most solo founders spend their first 3-4 weeks struggling with authentication flows, global tax compliance, and database schema design. This "boilerplate fatigue" often leads to project abandonment before the actual AI value proposition is even built. AgentFast eliminates this hurdle by providing a unified, production-ready core from day one.

## Slide 3: AgentFast provides a production-ready shortcut to profitability
### Launch a fully monetized AI application with zero infrastructure overhead.
The boilerplate comes pre-integrated with Clerk for secure authentication, Supabase for a scalable PostgreSQL database, and Lemon Squeezy for global payment processing. This means you can go from a blank repository to a live, paying-customer-ready application in less than a week, significantly reducing your time-to-market and increasing your ROI.

## Slide 4: A modern, high-performance stack ensures long-term scalability
### Leverage the latest stable technologies for a fast and reliable user experience.
- **Next.js 16 (App Router)**: Utilizes Server Components and Actions for maximum speed and SEO.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Provides a type-safe, lightweight interface to your Supabase PostgreSQL database.
- **Clerk Auth**: Offers a seamless, secure login experience with social and magic link support.
- **Lemon Squeezy**: Handles global sales tax (VAT/GST) automatically, removing a major legal hurdle.
- **Vercel AI SDK**: A unified core for streaming responses from any major AI provider.

## Slide 5: Automated global monetization removes the complexity of sales tax
### Lemon Squeezy integration handles compliance and subscriptions out of the box.
AgentFast includes pre-built webhook handlers that automatically sync subscription status from Lemon Squeezy to your database. This ensures that your users' access levels are always accurate. By acting as your Merchant of Record, Lemon Squeezy handles all the tax complexity, allowing you to sell your AI SaaS globally without legal headaches.

## Slide 6: Multi-provider AI support prevents vendor lock-in and optimizes costs
### Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and Gemini with a single configuration change.
The Vercel AI SDK integration allows you to leverage the best model for each specific task. Whether you need the reasoning of Claude 3.5 Sonnet or the speed of Groq's Llama 3, AgentFast makes it trivial to switch. Built-in token tracking logs every request, giving you full visibility into your operational costs and user usage patterns.

## Slide 7: Security-audited infrastructure protects your margins and API keys
### v1.2 features enhanced rate limiting, input sanitization, and circuit breakers.
AgentFast v1.2 includes a robust security layer. It uses Upstash Redis for sliding window rate limiting (10 requests per 10 seconds) and includes a circuit breaker pattern to handle AI provider failures gracefully. Furthermore, the boilerplate enforces plan-based usage limits by querying the database before every AI request, ensuring that users stay within their paid tiers.

## Slide 8: Five pre-built AI templates provide a head start for any use case
### Don't start from scratch—use our battle-tested UI patterns for common AI apps.
- **Streaming Chatbot**: A ChatGPT-like interface with real-time response streaming.
- **Content Generator**: Optimized for long-form text and marketing copy generation.
- **Image Generation**: Integrated UI for DALL-E and other image models.
- **Agent Skeleton**: A foundation for building autonomous AI agents.
- **RAG Q&A**: Pre-configured for "Chat with your PDF" and knowledge base applications.

## Slide 9: A £180 lifetime investment pays for itself with your first customer
### Stop paying monthly subscriptions for tools you can own forever.
Unlike other "SaaS-as-a-Service" platforms that charge monthly fees, AgentFast is a one-time purchase. For £180, you get full access to the source code and all future updates. Considering it saves roughly 100+ hours of senior developer time, the boilerplate offers an immediate 10x return on investment for any serious founder.
